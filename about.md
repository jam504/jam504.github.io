### About me

I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh seeking to earn a degree in information science with a minor in statistics and with specific interests in english film, filmmaking, and literature in order to get into the data science field with a unique perspective on the storytelling aspect of data and how it can effectively be presented.

### Other interests

<ul>
  <li>Soccer – Whether it be playing soccer or following it, I cannot get enough. I play every week with other members of my gender-inclusive honor fraternity, Phi Sigma Pi, and follow the Premier League closely.</li>
  <li>Music – As a kid I used to imagine that my life had its very own soundtrack.  Music has always been a part of my life from listening to classic rock with my dad in the car to indie pop on spotify on a rainy day.</li>
  <li>Film – (unfinished)</li>
</ul>
